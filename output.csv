There are Brown, Black, Antic Black and Green OptionsThe sizes are 4 3/8"" x 3 3/8"" x 3/4"" (When it is empty)It is made from Genuine Cowhide LeatherThe best way to avoid staining your wallet is to wipe everything away right when it gets on the leather. This includes simple water spills—full grain leather is water resistant, but letting water sit on your product for a prolonged time will still leave a stain. Make sure to immediately wipe away any spills or smudges. If you want to be extra sure to keep your leather looking pristine, it’s a good idea to wipe it down with a slightly damp cloth every so often and clean it with soap and water once every few months. This will also reduce any marks that come with the natural oils on your hands, although many leather owners find these marks to be a desirable trait instead of something to be avoided. The Leather wallet is great to use and gift to loved ones. It is the best gift for boyfriend, husband, dad and grandpa for anniversary, birthday or Valentine's DayYou feel so soft like silk when you touch the full-grain leather wallet.You can use it to carry cash, credit card, coins and IDIt will fit your regular back pocket or jacket pocket.If you do not like you can return and exchange it in 30 daysIt will arrive in the Golden Horn Special Gift box with yellow ribbon.I can engrave on it for you.

This might be risked and buyer accountability, we will not be responsible for any damaged or confiscated by customs at the destination ****** Some countries, buyers are required Import Permit please check with your custom ***Description:- Gymnocalycium mihanovichii is known as ""Gymno"". The trunk is spherical with spines separated from the trunk clearly. The dominant and popular species is the colored gymnocalycium (moon cactus). It is a peripheral or “grafted”, which comes in a variety of colors such as red, yellow, orange with beautiful and unusual patterns. - Gymnocalycium mihanovichii variegated is known as ""Gymno Var."" It was developed from the common green gymnocalycium with the colored gymnocalycium (moon cactus). This will be challenging for growers or collectors to be breeding the gymnocalycium becomes strange colors or pattern.- Cactus takes up little space, is easy to care for and does not require daily watering.Upon arrival of your cactus:- Let your cactus feel familiar to their new environment surroundings before planting. Potted media:- Prepare a pot with drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. The size of the pot should be slightly larger than the size of the cactus.Growth mixes:- Soil ingredients are orchid bark, pearlite, loam or soil, pincers, peat moss, coconut fibers and pumice. Alright, now it's time to plant:1. Put the potting material into the pot about 1/3 part, to allow water to flow well.2. Scoop the mixes soil to plant the cactus, estimate the depth to fit the plant and root.3. Plant the cactus in the center of the pot and gently scoop the soil around the plant, about 1 cm below the rim.4. Fill up a small amount of osmocote fertilizer or slow dissolving fertilizer.  Never mind, if there is no fertilizer, this step can be skipped, because in the mixes soil growing cactus already contains nutrients and minerals.5.Sprinkle topping with a small gravel or rocks or pumice. Do not sprinkle too thick.6. Newly planted cactus should be placed in a shelter first and gradually out in the morning and evening for about a week before being fed with other cactus.Tip:- Fertilizing should be applied every 3-6 months and over-fertilization can cause the cactus to die.- Do not re-pot during the rainy season, because it is most vulnerable to rot. In addition, when re-pot, it should not be watered immediately. Should be left for 5-7 days for normal watering.- If the location allows to build the greenhouse, it should be covered the roof and bulkhead around the greenhouse with clear plastic 200 microns or more and 50-60 percent camouflage with slants for cactus storage. The cactus is fully grown and beautiful skin when it is in the suitable environment and receives sufficient sunlight each day.- Watering, monitor soil moisture. This can be done with a toothpick or a small paintbrush handle to dip it into the soil. If wet soil stains are attached, it means that the soil is not dry and cactus also do not need water. If the soil starts to dry out then it should be watered.Payment:- Payment via Paypal within 3 days after reserved. We are not allowed to add the credit card information in the system. So, we cannot accept the payment channel via a credit card.- We are pleased to offer wholesale prices or combined shipping for customers, please contact us for further information.Shipping:*** We usually ship cactus plants without the Phytosanitary Certificate ****** Cactus plants are defined in CITES list, we cannot provide the Phytosanitary Certificate to customers.
